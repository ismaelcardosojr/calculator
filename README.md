A simple calculator based on Google's. In **JavaScript**, some tags/concepts worth mentioning are:

The project originates from this free course on Youtube:
* www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnDvRpP8BneysKU8KivhnrVaKpILD3gZ6 - **kudos to teacher Matheus** ‚ù§Ô∏è

Instead of just copying what would be instructed, I analyzed the page final result and, in order to reproduce it, developed the project by myself.
